We need a consensus (parser), consensus_work.c , consensus_work.h

consensus parser - main call 
Arguments:
-p port num
-n connecting port numbers (separated by commas)
-c credit
-d debit
-q query
Work within Main:
- call initialize for the program

consensus_work.h -
global variable of current balance = 0

consensus_work -
-initialize - initializing the instance with correct port num, and sockets to other port,
uses consensus protocol to check (if other port balances are 0)
-credit(money) - itself is coordinator which checks (always passes) with other ports, and then credits to account 
-debit(money) - itself coordinator which checks (that there's enough money) with other ports, and then debits to account
-query - return current balance

***also need to look up how to do fail case where program terminates, and how to notify other ports that this port is now invalid***

dollars only?
